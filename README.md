# CodixPlay

CodixPlay is a C++ application project that offers a visual representation of various data structures. From static arrays to stacks and queues, CodixPlay provides an interactive visualization of these structures, allowing users to observe their behaviors and operations in real-time.

## Features

### Supported Data Structures:
  * Static Array
  * Dynamic Array
  * Singly Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Circular Linked List
  * Stack
  * Queue

### Interactive Visualization:
  * Adjust visualization speed
  * Step-by-step algorithm playback
  * Backtracking to previous steps
  * Insert data structures from files
  * Side-by-side code display for corresponding algorithms

### Customizable UI/UX:
  * Color customization for data structure visualization
